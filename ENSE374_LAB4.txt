System Design Document
1 Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose is to create a closed virtual environment that simulates a given food chain of animals without any external 

forces affecting the environment ( ie. weather). 

1.2 Design Goals
The rules laid out shall be:
• World is 150 kms square. Carve up the world into a grid of 150/150 (2D environment)
• Animals without wings can travel three kms in a day. (3 grid locations)
• Animals with wings can travel 5kms.
• Insects can travel 1km.
• Everything must eat within two days.
• No reproducing of any kind. Everything will die.
• Print out only what is living at each location.
• Grass, shrubs, and trees will not move
• Animals and insects will randomly spawn 
• No data will be saved 
• Animals and insects will have bottomless stomaches (no eating limiting) 
• Animals will not move through each other 
• The program will be sequential (one thing only moving at a time) 
• Animals will not have an escape option 	
• Will show text instead of ACII representation (ex. "Wolf moving") 
• User is able to choose the starting animal 
• One iteration through the main loop 

2 Current Software Architecture 
Based on a new design 

3 Proposed software architecture
3.1 Overview
The programming language is Java and the application will run on a personal computer.

3.2 Subsystem decomposition
UML Diagram. Specifically a class diagram. It will specifically include a world  with animals, and inheritance.

3.3 Boundary conditions
When world is created the user shall be allowed to populate the world. If a user inputs far too
many items an error shall be received.

Based on the info provided in todays lab you may revise your UML Class diagram and begin Coding.  What I want to see by next lab period is the ability to randomly place things in your world.  Then iterate through the world and indicate what is living there by printing to the screen.   The due date is Nov 9th or Nov 10 depending on your lab day.  Put all your code under revision control and I (or my grader) will check out code up until your due date so make sure you get your code up to your repository.   If your design changes during your software development you must modify your SDD and UML Class diagram to reflect the changes.  I will add a new Milestone next week.
